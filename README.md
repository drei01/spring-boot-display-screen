# Display Dashboard

To run the server you will need the following `java environment` variables set:

```
--clientId
--clientSecret
--refreshToken
```

You can create the client id and client secret using the [Google developer
console][1]. You need to generate the refresh token, there is a [short Ruby
script to create one for you][2].
